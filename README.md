HEO Code Challenge



### Running the app
```
ruby app.rb
```
### Running the tests
```
bundle install
cd spec
rspec
```

## Assumptions
##### Some General Assumptions I made
- The Data itself was almost too large to analyse by eye


## Todo
- Write some scenarios for working together
- Bit of practice for test exercises, take an app and think how you'd test it - may be more likely to be a UI one as your squad is
  - BVA
  - White Box
  - Black Box
  - Unit
  - Functional
- Write a code presentation to ensure you don't miss anything - check email to go over the points
