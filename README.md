HEO Code Challenge

The code that performs the tasks (calls the methods, etc). Is in app.rb. Can run this by doing the following:

### Running the code
```
ruby app.rb
```

Wrote unit tests for the functions that were possible to write for
### Running the tests
```
bundle install
cd spec
rspec - followed by the spec file you want to run
```

## Assumptions

##### Some General things and Assumptions I made
###### General Things
- Made a smaller file to run the code against as it was easier to analyse/understand
- Outputted all created reg codes to a csv
###### Assumptions
- The Data itself was almost too large to analyse by eye
- On a look through, London was the only reg area that wouldn't register, used this to do lots of things\
- I can remove any reference to the make, vin, and colour as they aren't used to define the registration numbers

## Playground
- Playground isn't a runnable file. Was just a file I used for research/experimentation
